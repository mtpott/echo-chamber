## Description
The Echo Chamber is a social media site that is purely dedicated to creating relationships through music. When you log into the site, you’re greeted by albums of all kinds-–ones from artists you like but you haven’t listened to, or ones you haven’t seen before, or maybe it’s your favorite album of all time! You can save those albums to your page for you to listen to later. When you give a new album a listen, share your thoughts by adding a comment. Then, other users can reply to your comment too! With the Echo Chamber, you can create relationships with other users who share a similar taste in music, or who can introduce you to an artist you’ve never heard before!
